This repository contains the code for the following publication: Automatic 3D Point Set Reconstruction from Stereo Laparoscopic Images using Deep Neural Networks, In Proceedings of the 6th International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Embedded Computing and Communication Systems (PECCS 2016), pages 116-121
This codes is to predict 3D coordinates from stereo laparoscopic images. The approach maps a vector of pixel intensities to 3D coordinates through training a six layer deep neural network.
